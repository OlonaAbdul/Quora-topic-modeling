# Quora-topic-modeling
#### This project utilizes Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to perform topic modeling on a dataset of 400,000 Quora questions. The goal is to extract meaningful topics and gain insights from the questions asked on the Quora platform.
## Dataset
#### The dataset used in this project consists of 400,000 Quora questions collected from the Quora API. Each question is represented as a text document and will be used to identify underlying topics through LDA.
## Results
#### The topic modeling analysis will generate 20 topics along with their corresponding keywords. These topics represent the underlying themes in the Quora questions and provide insights into the interests and concerns of Quora users.
#### The results can be further analyzed, visualized, or used for downstream tasks such as content recommendation, question clustering, or user profiling.
## Future Improvements
#### Here are some ideas for future improvements and extensions of this project:
#### 1. Explore different variations of LDA, such as Hierarchical LDA or Dynamic Topic Modeling, to capture temporal dynamics or hierarchical structures in the dataset.
#### 2. Perform topic coherence evaluation to assess the quality and interpretability of the extracted topics.
#### 3. Develop a web application or API to allow users to interactively explore the topics and search for relevant questions.
#### 4. Conduct sentiment analysis on the questions to understand the sentiment associated with different topics.
#### 5. Incorporate additional data sources or metadata (e.g., user demographics) to enhance the topic modeling analysis.
